## Week One: Brainstorming and precedents

This week, we saw the basic project outline. We are tasked with designing an intervention that takes energy from the enviroment and uses it. 
We discussed what that could mean, and how we could implement it. We saw examples, such as the strandbeests, wind powered artworks that walk around the environment
