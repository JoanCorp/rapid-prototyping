## Week Five: First concrete steps

The first thing we did this week was an activity focusing on systems design thinking. The collections subteam worked on this activity
together, thinking about how the components of our subsystem fit together, what its overall purpose was, and what its positive and 
negative effects would be on the rest of the system and the surrounding environment.

The class also saw some components brought in from Mike Short's lab that could be of use to the project. We saw steel boxes that held
salt, which were meant to store heat in molten salt for domestic use in Mongolia for cooking. We also saw a Mongolian stovetop that
was meant to be used with the boxes. These molten salt boxes are a fixed starting point that we will use to further develop our project.

The collections team thought about what concrete steps we could take in prototyping. While we have decided not to close off alternate avenues such as fresnel lenses
yet, we have decided to stat with the vacuum formed mylar mirror idea that I found, as that is cheap and easy to manufacture while having high reflector
quality, ideal for early prototyping.
