## Week Four: Further Research, and Pinup One

This week, the collection group further researched collecting solar energy for the solar cooker project, research we presented at the end of the week
as part of our pinup.

Josh researched the energy of the sun reaching earth, finding how the emission spectrum of the sun would interact with the absorbtion of different components of 
the atmosphere, finding that the average irradiance at the Earth's surface is 21.6 MJ/m^2 per day.

We researched four methods of solar collection, a fresnel lens, a parabolic mirror approximated by flat plates, a linear fresnel reflector, and a low cost
near-parabolic reflector. 

Calvin researched a fresnel lens, finding that with the known efficiency of 0.82 [2](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2014/787392/) and an area of 0.627 m^2 [3](https://greenpowerscience.com/FRESNELSHOP/46INCHLINEAR.html) , commonly available commercially, 
11.1 MJ/day could be collected. The fresnel lens also had the added benefits of being simple and depositing energy evenly.

Haeri researched a parabolic trough reflector. A parabolic trough is a parabola stretched into the third dimension, which would focus the energy on
a beam above the trough. This would allow collection without focusing too much energy on a single point, and reduce thermal losses.

I researched a method of producing near parabolic reflectors cheaply and easily. By stretching a film of highly reflective mylar over a circular
frame and applying a vacuum, a smooth, curved reflective surface would be formed, which sould allow for easy production of high quality solar concentrators.
The primary downsides are the inexactness of the form, and the fact that a vacuum must be periodically reapplied to compensate for leaks. I wasn't
able to properly finish this research by the time of the pinup, so it wasn't included

David researched how tracking would affect the energy collection. He found that tracking helps about 50 W at peak hours and 100 W before and after[4](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2014.11.19/main.png). The tracking 
also did not have to be too accurate, due to cosine dependence. A 5 degree deflection would still result in 99.6% of energy being captured
