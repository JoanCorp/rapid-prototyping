## Week Seven: Further conceptuialzation and integration planning

The solar collections group is now following three main paths for poetential prototyping: a vacuum formed mylar mirror, a fiberglass backed mylar mirror, and
a segmented mirror. 

The vacuum formed mylar mirror has been what we have been experimenting with recently, shaping plastic and mylar with a vacuum. We have faced some problems,
as the mylar we have is too thick to be effectively formed into shape. This will also not work, as the current integrated design requires a hole in the center
of the concentrator.

The second design concept is similar to the first. We use pressure to form the mylar, and then back it with fiberglass so it maintains its shape. This can be cut
to the right shape, but is more complex to manufacture

Our third, and current concept is to manufacture the mirror from small segments. We made prototypes using the mylar stretched over laser cut segments. This
also could let us explore prototyping a Scheffler reflector. This is a specific form of reflector design that allows for easy solar tracking, and has history of 
successful use around the world

On wednesday, we saw the integrated design concept, so we could further our prototyping, and begand work on the presentation for the mid review, to outline progress
on our concentrator designs.
