## Week Six: Starting to prototype

This week, Joseph and I began to prototype the collection system. We started by experimenting with the vacuum stretched mylar
reflector idea. We didn't have mylar, so we experimented with clear vinyl and aluminum foil. 

We started by testing the vinyl. We taped it to the top of a vacuum chamber, and used a hand pump to remove the air. Not much was happening, so we decided 
to replace the double sided tape seal with a layer of duct tape which the double sided tape would seal to instead.
This was able to create a proper seal, and once we started pumping out the air, even a small pressure difference created visible deformation.

Next, to see what would happen with a reflective surface, we started prototyping with aluminum foil. This did not work as well,
as aluminum foil does not stretch and it instead bunched up. We were able to calculate what the hypothetical focal point of this configuration 
was, and figured out some next steps for actual prototyping.
