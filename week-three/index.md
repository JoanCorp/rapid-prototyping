## Week Three: Energy capture 

This week, we organized into three subteams, for energy capture, storage, and use. I was on the capture subteam, where we discussed various methods.
Joseph calculated the power yields of various energy sources from a given space, comparing solar, wind, walking energy capture, and rain energy.

Given a 2 square meter area:
1. Solar: 1.28 kW
2. Wind: 27.4 W
3. Walking: 28.2 W
4. Rain: 42 mW

We then discussed various ways to capture this energy:

- Capture step energy from a rack and pinion system that gets energy from a platform squished in a step
- Using elevated wind power such as balloon wind turbines or kites
- Using compost to heat up water- goes with shower idea someone else mentioned

The next day, we came together as a class to discuss what we should choose as a group project, and we settled on the general idea of a solar cooker. We throught of how to achieve this, and how to cook for long periods of time. One precedent was the sunbucket, which used latent heat to keep cooking even without sunshine.
