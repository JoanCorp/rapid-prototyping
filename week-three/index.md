## Week Three: Energy capture 

This week, we organized into three subteams, for energy capture, storage, and use. I was on the capture subteam, where we discussed various methods.
Joseph calculated the power yields of various energy sources from a given space, comparing solar, wind, walking energy capture, and rain energy.

Given a 2 square meter area:
1. Solar: 1.28 kW
2. Wind: 27.4 W
3. Walking: 28.2 W
4. Rain: 42 mW

We then discussed various ways to capture this energy:

-Capture step energy from a rack and pinion system that gets energy from a platform squished in a step
-Using elevated wind power such as balloon wind turbines or kites
-Using compost to heat up water- goes with shower idea someone else mentioned
