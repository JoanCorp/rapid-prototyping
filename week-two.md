## Week Two: Small Group Brainstorming

This week, we further focused on brainstorming. First, we had a whole class discussion for brainstorming.
We talked about how energy could be harnessed, stored, and used. We also considered who this intervention would be for, and what impacts it could have.
We then brainstormed in small groups. My small group discussed a few ideas, such as storing energy by moving weight up and down, and
demonstrating the greenhouse effect in a hands on way. One idea we eventually focused on was affectionately called the "Grilling Chilling Pavillion",
a solar energy demonstrator that would provide college students with their most in-demand resource: free food.
